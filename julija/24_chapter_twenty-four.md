**180**

I had a very beautiful and unique dream today. I forgot a lot related to it the moment I woke up, though. 
Me and my lover – who wasn’t Julija, but someone I have never seen before – were subjected to a sham trial in the court of a woman tyrant. As we were aware that we are facing certain death, we made a pact that, when the process ends, we will die together while declaring our love to each other. And so we did. For some reason, our bodies were tied together, and we were facing the same direction; our hands were tied and lifted in the crucifix position. I think we participated in a mass execution event, but I did not bother to look around. I kept saying, “We are together,” and my lover kept replying, “We are together,” and, “I love you” – “I love you.” The killing place was a closed chamber; the floor was made of brown wood, and there were also red carpets, red tapestry. We were dressed in red-white regal clothes. When the mechanism of death went in motion, unannounced, the footstool fell on its side; dangling, I felt pressure on my neck. I said, “I love you,” but my lover did not reply. It appeared to me as if she were slightly overwhelmed. In the end, to my relief, she turned her head to the right, looked me in the eyes, and proclaimed, “I love you.” She quickly lost consciousness, while I was still there, dying unusually long; I even checked my feet to see if I’m touching the ground. When I was about to faint, I woke up. Our execution was peaceful and dignified enough, even though hanging is usually regarded as vulgar.

And I want to say that the Lover and I were not executed in the Flatlands; it happened in a foreign court. The situation in the Flatlands remains stable and familiar. The Lover exhibited the following outward characteristics: she had pale, white skin, dirty blond hair, and she was thin. She looked nothing like the ghost on crutches. Our death was strangely peaceful and beautiful, even though I could feel the rope’s strong pull.

I know that this was merely a dream and not a near-death vision, the redness of the room and our beautiful clothes, and the unusual serenity of our execution, however, elevated it to a very high position in my mindscape.
